input:
generate_soundex(""pari"")","Any vowels (A, E, I, O, U) within the string, except the first letter, should be ignored when converting the string to Soundex code.

6,TST_4_1,Handling vowel as first letter  ,"1)  Test cases where the first letter is a vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
2) Ensure proper encoding according to the Soundex rules.
3) Validate that the vowel is retained as the first letter and                 the correct encoding for the subsequent characters is returned.","Strings with vowels as the first character.

input:
generate_soundex(""Oliver"")","The first letter of the input string should be retained in the Soundex code, even if it is a vowel.
Test where the first letter is ""O"". Check for proper retention of the vowel and correct encoding of the rest of the name.
output:
""O416""

7,TST_5_0,Handling Adjacent Letters with the Same Number,"Ensure that the Soundex algorithm correctly processes adjacent letters with the same number, retaining only the first occurrence and ignoring the rest.
","Strings where two or more adjacent letters map to the same Soundex number.

input:
generate_soundex("" Butter"")","Only the first occurrence of adjacent letters with the same Soundex number should be retained in the encoded result.
Subsequent adjacent letters with the same number should be ignored.

8,TST_6_0," Letters with the Same Number Separated by 'H', 'W' , 'Y'","Ensure that letters separated by 'H', 'W', or 'Y' and having the same Soundex number are combined into a single number during encoding.","Strings where letters with the same Soundex number are separated by 'H', 'W', or 'Y'.

input:
generate_soundex(""Ashcraft"")","The final Soundex code should consolidate letters with the same number into a single digit, if separation by 'H', 'W', or 'Y'.

Verify that 'S' and 'C' (both mapped to 2) are treated as one, as its separation by 'H' and 'W'.
output:
""A261"""
9,TST_7_0, Letters with the Same Number Separated by a Vowel,"Ensure that letters with the same Soundex number, separated by a vowel, are each encoded as their respective numbers in the final Soundex code.
Verify that the Soundex algorithm does not combine these numbers but includes each occurrence.","Strings with pairs of letters that map to the same Soundex number, separated by vowels.

Input:
generate_soundex(""Tymczak"")
